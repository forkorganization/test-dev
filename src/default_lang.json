CrowdRise makes it super easy and fun, and your support is invaluable to our mission.  Consider giving up your next birthday by asking for donations instead of gifts.  Or run a marathon and ask your friends to sponsor you. We love getting donations but there's nothing better than when you go a step further and help us raise money from your network of friends. Lots of little donations really do add up.  The power of the crowd is real.   Please create a fundraiser and help us make a real-life difference for this incredibly important cause.","default_why_vote":"Votes are worth 100 CrowdRise Impact Points.

So if you raise $2000 for your favorite cause, that's 20,000 CrowdRise Impact Points. You also earn 100 Impact Points every time someone in the CrowdRise Community votes for you so be sure to get all your friends on CrowdRise so they can vote for you. You can redeem your Impact Points for CrowdRise Rewards on this page. And worry not, when you redeem Points, your total CrowdRise Impact Points never go down so it won't affect the Lifetime Points you earn to achieve CrowdRise Royalty Status and CrowdRise Badges. When you redeem Points, it only affects how many Points you have left to spend on more rewards. One last note of advice we like to give on all Rewards pages. Don't be afraid to kiss on a first date. Every girlfriend I've ever had, except for maybe one, let me kiss her on the first date.","redeemPoints_error_message":"So sorry but can you try closing this box, refreshing the page and trying whatever you were doing again.
