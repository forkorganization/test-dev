# InstallAnywhere Localization File
#
# External strings for locale: English (en)
# See the 'ProjectLocalizationInfo.txt' file in this same directory for information 
#     regarding mappings between the properties shown below and your InstallAnywhere
#     project.
#
# External/Locale property names can take one of three forms:
#     <ActionName>.<ReferenceID>.<ActionProperty>          (e.g., Installer.858175031081.productName)
#     <ActionName>.<ReferenceID>.<ActionProperty>.<Index>  (e.g., Installer.858175031081.installLabels.01)
#         - where the <ActionProperty> is a Vector and the <Index> represents the place within the
#           Vector where the value of the property should be inserted
#     _ia.<SomeProperty>                                   (e.g., _ia.MyCustomCodePanelProperty)
#         - where <SomeProperty> is used as an identifier for a localized value by custom code
#
# External/Locale property values should be plain text strings.  Special or i18n characters
#     that cannot be represented by ASCII characters should be written using escaped unicode.
#     - see the utility 'native2ascii' distributed with your JDK
